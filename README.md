# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mac! (he/his)

## I'm a Full Stack Developer, a handyman/inventor, a problem solver, a proud Border Collie dad.

I recently shifted careers from heavy-duty mechanics due to Covid-19. I've always been interested in IT. For years I've worked as a computer technician and was interested in learning to code but never made the time to do so. Getting laid off during Covid-19 gave me the time I needed to finally take the leap and learn. I recently completed the .Net Core course at ComIT. After the course, I did online courses on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node and React. I'm excited to make a positive impact on the world, one line of code at a time!

## My skillset includes:

### :speech_balloon: Ask me about: Fixing stuff!

- I believe in the right to repair and always try to save things from being scraped even if they don't have much value. In some cases, I fix it until it is completely broken ðŸ˜„ but at least I try and learn new skills on the way.

- StarCraft and Starcraft II
- DOOM 3
- Resident Evil 4
